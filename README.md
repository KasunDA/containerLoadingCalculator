Container Loading Calculator

Calculate maximum number of a given box which can be loaded into a sea container.

You need:
1) A python IDE installed (for example: IDLE or Wing)

To make it work:
1) Simply run the code in your Python IDE
2) It will prompt you to enter the container type you want: 40', 20' etc
3) Then it will prompt you to enter the size of the box you want to load. Note, so far I have only added
functionality for loading a single type of box rather than multiple different sized boxes in one container
4) Finally it will print the quantity and loading schematic

Please email me if you find any bugs or need any further help.
